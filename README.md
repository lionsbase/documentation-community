# LionsBase Community Documentation

This is a community-driven LionsBase documentation.

Please feel free to clone this repository and contribute back.

This documentation is using [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) as markup
language. This is similar to Markdown but has the benefit of supporting aggregation
as multi-chapter documentation automatically.

To clone and render the documentation locally, please do so:

```
git clone https://github.com/lionsbase/documentation-community.git
cd documentation-community/
make html
```

and then simply open `documentation-community/_build/html/index.html` with your
favourite browser.

Thanks for contributing
